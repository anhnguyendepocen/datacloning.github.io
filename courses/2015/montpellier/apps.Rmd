## How to run the apps

[Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps can be run from within 
[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) by opening the 
**raw** [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

Before being able to run apps from within RStudio, make sure to
install the `shiny` [R](http://www.r-project.org) package:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
```

Once opened, a **Run document** should be visible. Click on that,
and the app will run through RStudio's built-in local web server.

The **html** link leads to a web page that shows the R code used in the app.
