# Course directory guidelines

The `index.md` and corresponding `index.html` lists courses (at some point can be auto generated, but it is not a huge priority).

Subdirectories follow the pattern `./year/town/`.

Within each course directory, there are the following files:

* `index.md`: course flyer with TOC, linking to the lectures,
* the lectures:
  - `lecture-00.Rmd` is about general install/setup stuff,
  - `lecture-01.Rmd` ... `lecture-xx.Rmd` are the lectures,
* any other supporting file necessary
* `*.pdf` versions of the lectures for easier offline use.
