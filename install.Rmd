## Install R

Follow the instructions at the [R website](http://cran.r-project.org) to download and install
the most up-to-date base R version suitable for your operating system.

## Install RStudio

Having RStudio is not absolutely necessary, but material
on the website follows a syntax that is close to RStudio's [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
notation. 
RStudio is available for different operating systems. Pick the open source descktop edition from [here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Some material on the website also contains [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps for demonstration purposes, this is where RStudio
comes handy again. To be able to run Shiny apps, install the
`shiny` package:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
```

## Install JAGS

JAGS is robust, easy to install, and cross-paltform available. Download the latest version suitable for your operating system from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/3.x/).

Once R/RStudio and JAGS are installed, run the following command in R/RStudio to install the necessary R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("rjags", "dclone", "coda", "snow", "rlecuyer"))
```

## Install WinBUGS

Install links. Cross-platform issues.

Get WinBUGS from [this website](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/), apply the patch and use the immortality key for best result.

Once R/RStudio and WinBUGS are installed, run the following command in R/RStudio to install the necessary R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("R2WinBUGS", "dclone", "coda", "snow", "rlecuyer"))
```

## Install OpenBUGS

Get OpenBUGS by following the installation guide 
from [this website](http://www.openbugs.net/w/Downloads).

Once R/RStudio and OpenBUGS are installed, run the following command in R/RStudio to install the necessary R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("R2OpenBUGS", "dclone", "coda",
    "BRugs", "snow", "rlecuyer"))
```

## Install Stan

Follow the steps on the [Stan website](http://mc-stan.org/rstan.html) and 
[wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) to install Stan and RStan.

Once R/RStudio and Stan/`RStan` are installed, run the following command in R/RStudio to install other necessary R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("dclone", "coda", "snow", "rlecuyer"))
```

Because `RStan` is not available via [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org),
the data cloning related Stan functions in the `dcextras` R package
can only be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/datacloning/dcextras). Make sure to update the `devtools` package as
described [here](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("datacloning/dcextras")
```

## Development version of `dclone`

To install development version of `dclone`, install
it from GitHub:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("datacloning/dclone")
