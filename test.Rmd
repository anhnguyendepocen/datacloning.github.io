## Here is a website

Paragraph text.

Some MathJax: inline eq $$ x_{i}=exp(\lambda^2_{i}) $$ like this.

Or:

$$ a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2} $$


Some MathJax: \\(x_{i}=exp(\lambda^2_{i}))\\

Or:

\\[ a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2} ]\\

This is inline `code` and this is code block:

```R
## with some notes
a <- 1 + 2 # here
(b <- a * 2)
```

Well.

Lists:

1. One,
2. Two.

And:

* item
* item
  and beyond

finally GFM checkbox:

- [ ] todo 1
- [x] done,
- [ ] not.

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
