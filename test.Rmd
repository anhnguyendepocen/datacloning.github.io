# Start with a header

This `Rmd` file demonstrates how we intend to host text/code
on the website. We have 3 aims:

1. Folks can read the text/code on the web and
  copy/paste for themselves
2. The file opens up in Rstudio, and can be turned into some
  other format
2. We can delop text/code/math without polluting our workspace
  with ugly html stuff.

This is plain text

End a line with two spaces
to start a new paragraph.  

*italics* and _italics_

**bold** and __bold__

superscript^2^

~~strikethrough~~

##### Header 5

###### Header 6

endash: --

emdash: ---

ellipsis: ...

inline equation: $$A = \pi*r^{2}$$

$$A = \pi*r^{2}$$

horizontal rule (or slide break):

* unordered list
* item 2

1. ordered list
2. item 2
 + sub-item 1
 + sub-item 2

Table Header | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Table Cell | Cell 2
Cell 3 | Cell 4 

Make a code chunk with three back ticks followed
by an r in braces. End the chunk with three back
ticks: 

```R
paste("Hello", "World!")
``` 

Place code inline with a single back ticks. The
first back tick must be followed by an R, like
this `paste("Hello", "World!")`.

Add chunk options within braces. For example,
`echo=FALSE` will prevent source code from being
displayed:

```R
paste("Hello", "World!")
``` 


# Data cloning

## Here is a website

Paragraph text.

Some MathJax: inline eq $$ x_{i}=exp(\lambda^2_{i}) $$ like this.

Or:

$$ a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2} $$


Some MathJax: \\(x_{i}=exp(\lambda^2_{i}))\\

Or:

\\[ a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2} ]\\

This is inline `code` and this is code block:

```R
## with some notes
a <- 1 + 2 # here
(b <- a * 2)
```

Well.

Lists:

1. One,
2. Two.

And:

* item
* item
  and beyond

finally GFM checkbox:

- [ ] todo 1
- [x] done,
- [ ] not.

First Header | Second Header

Content in the first column | Content in the second column

An ~~this is strikeout~~ text.

Is it?
